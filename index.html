<h1 style="text-align: center;">Low Latino Representation in Queen's Streets and Monuments. </h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The interactive mapping project Queens Name Explorer shows a very low number of streets and monuments named after Latino personalities despite the high percentage of historical Hispanic population across Queens' neighbourhoods. </h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> words by Maria D. Martinez | Monday, Dec 19. 2022</p></h3> <br>

<p>The Astoria neighborhood in Queens was renamed in 1840 to honor John Jacob Astor, a millionaire businessman whose Manhattan mansion could be seen across the East River. The founders, in their requalification work, wanted to get Mr. Astor to finance them. Astor gave them $500 and never set foot in "his Astoria."</p>

<p>Currently, the renaming of areas, streets, monuments and buildings acquires a community impact component. The honorary names belong to people who have represented and represent a valuable memory in the life of that neighborhood. Queens Name Explorer is the platform promoted by the Queens Memory Project, Queens Public Library and Urban Archive for the creation of an online repository that offers bibliographic data on the people behind the plaques, streets and monuments of Queens. <a href=https://github.com/mariadomrtnz/assignment2_datachart.git>In a previous article</a>a we found out that from the 1,138 entries that Queens Name Explorer has to date, only 24 are of Hispanic/Latino heritage. In a neighborhood where the Hispanic community has represented more than a quarter of the total population since the 1990s, it becomes, to say the least, curious.</p>

<br>
<figcaption>The sign at the corner of 37th Avenue and 78th Street in Jackson Heights commemorates the figure of Julio Rivera, a Puerto Rican and gay man brutally murdered in 1990 by three skinheads in a nearby schoolyard.
Rivera's murder spurred LGBT mobilization in Queens. It was also the first homosexual hate crime to be tried in court in the state of New York.</figcaption>

<p>A few weeks after its official presentation at Queens Public Library in Flushing, the Queens Name Explorer project is ready to gather and receive information on the individuals that have been identified as honorary titles for streets, monuments, parks, buildings, schools and other public places in the borough of Queens. But the first set of names shows an interesting dynamic that is not representative of Queens' extremely diverse demographic heritage, with the <a href="https://usafacts.org/data/topics/people-society/population-and-demographics/our-changing-population/state/new-york/county/queens-county?endDate=2021-01-01&startDate=1991-01-01">Latino community representing the second biggest percentage of Queens population for over 30 years</a> now. </p>

<p>Natalie Mildbrot, director of the Queens Memory Project and leader of the Queens Name Explorer initiative explained the efforts towards enhancing awareness of communities not represented or underrepresented: <i>"Right now we're in a first phase of our project where we're trying to just get all the entries published and trying to get demographic information (...) once we have that demographic information for everybody, we're going to be doing comparisons of the demographics of the people who live in the community board districts (...) Does it match the same things people ask or is there a disconnect? Is there a gap in representation? So we're gonna do that, but we just are not there yet.</i></p>

<p>Mildbrot also emphasized this is a project open to the public and they need the community to participate and help gather and verify information.</p>

<p>The Queens Name Explorer is an open and live initiative. More information on how to submit entries and participate can be found <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiMNu71uq34>here.</a></p>
