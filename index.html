<h1 style="text-align: center;">Low Latino Representation in Queen's Streets and Monuments. </h1>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The interactive mapping project Queens Name Explorer shows a very low number of streets and monuments named after Latino personalities despite the high percentage of historical Hispanic population across Queens' neighborhoods. </h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"> words by Maria D. Martinez | Monday, Dec 19. 2022</p></h3> <br>

<p>The Astoria neighborhood in Queens was renamed in 1840 to honor John Jacob Astor, a millionaire businessman whose Manhattan mansion could be seen across the East River. Founders of this new NY area wanted to get Mr. Astor to finance their project. Astor gave them $500 and never set foot in "his Astoria". Currently, the renaming of areas, streets, monuments and buildings acquires a <span style="color: orange">community impact component</span>. The honorary names belong to people who represent a valuable memory in the life of that neighborhood.</p>

<p><a href=https://github.com/mariadomrtnz/assignment2_datachart.git>In a previous article</a> we found out that <span style="color: orange">from the 1,138 entries that mapping project Queens Name Explorer has to date, only 24 are of Hispanic/Latino heritage</span>. The <a href=https://bestneighborhood.org/race-in-queens-county-ny/>Bestneigborhood data visualization platform</a> places Queens at 98 out of 100 on a diversity scale, and places the population of Hispanic origin at 28%, above white (25%), Asian (25%) and black origin. (17%). Thus, the results shown by the project, do not seem to correspond to this plurality, and specifically, to the historically high percentage of the Hispanic community.</p>

<figcaption> <p>The sign at the corner of 37th Avenue and 78th Street in Jackson Heights is one of the honorary names from the list. It commemorates the figure of Julio Rivera, a Puerto Rican and gay man brutally murdered in 1990 by three skinheads in a nearby schoolyard. Rivera's murder spurred the LGBT mobilization in Queens. It was also the first gay hate crime to be dealt in court in the state of New York.</p>

<p>In this case it is important to know what the process of renaming these spaces is like. Joshua Jelly-Schapiro, professor at NYU and author of “Names of New York”, tells how after the unification of all the farmlands that are now Queens, many spaces acquired the names of the construction companies that restructured the spaces. For example, Rego Park (1920), whose name comes from the “Real Good Construction Company”. Joshua also mentions in his book that reflecting on place names requires considering issues not just of origins, but of power. It means asking who has the power to name and why.</p>

<p>This power dynamic has changed, everything starts from within communities. “We are the ones who have to raise awareness. <span style="color: orange">The honorary appointment process is driven by the people who contributed and contribute tremendously to their community”</span>, says Jelly-Schapiro.  Now we, as citizens, can rename or co-name a space. The process is as easy as filing a petition in our community district.</p>

<p>Queens Name Explorer relies on community power and knowledge to educate in collective history. Natalie Mildbrot, leader of the Queens Name Explorer initiative, encourages people to participate: “This is a call for the public to help verify and add stories. We want it to serve as a resource, there is no closing date, it is a living project”.
The Queens Name Explorer repository can be accessed and edited directly from its <a href=https://nameexplorer.urbanarchive.me/>website</a>.</p>
